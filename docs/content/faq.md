Why can't I just use NuGet?
---------------------------

**Q:** I don't understand why I need Paket to manage my packages. Why can't I just use NuGet?

**A:** NuGet doesn't separate out the concept of indirect dependencies; if you install a package into your project and that package has further dependencies then all indirect packages are included in the `packages.config` file. There is no way to tell which packages are only indirect dependencies. 

Even more importantly: if two packages reference conflicting versions of a package, NuGet will silently take the latest version; You have no control over this process.
 
Paket on the other hand maintains this information on a consistent and stable basis within the [lockfile](lockfile.html) in the solution root. This file, together with the `packages.fsx` enables you to determine exactly what's happening with your dependencies.

The [paket outdated](paket_outdated.html) command lists packages that have new versions available.

Future versions of Paket will also enable one to [reference files directly from git repositories](https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/issues/9).


**Q:** Why does Paket add references to the libraries of all the libraries framework versions in a NuGet package?

**A:** NuGet installs only for the currently matching .NET framework version of your project. Whenever you want to change the framework version you have to reinstall your NuGet packages. 
Paket installs all of them; but it adds conditional attributes.


**Q:** When I resolve the dependencies from NuGet.org it is really slow. Why is that?

**A:** Paket uses the NuGet oData API to discover package dependencies. Unfortunately this API is very slow. 

Some good news is that [the NuGet team are currently developing a faster API](http://blog.nuget.org/20140711/nuget-architecture.html); Paket may be able to take advantage of that.

Once the Lockfile is written Paket won't use the oData API anymore and therefore package restore is very fast.
